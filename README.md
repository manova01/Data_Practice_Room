### 📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction
## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses that rely on recurring customers. This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and modeling customer data to understand why customers leave and to predict churn before it happens.

The project follows a full data science workflow:

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Machine Learning Modeling & Evaluation

The final outcome is a predictive churn model supported by clear business insights.

# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Notebook: Data_Cleaning.ipynb

Objectives

Prepare raw customer data for analysis and modeling

Improve data quality and consistency

Ensure features are usable for machine learning

Key Activities

Handling missing values

Data type corrections

Encoding categorical variables

Feature selection and transformation

Removing inconsistencies and irrelevant columns

Outcome

A clean, structured dataset ready for exploratory analysis and machine learning.

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Notebook: Exploratory_Data_Analysis_(EDA)_–_Churn_Insights.ipynb

Objectives

Understand customer behavior patterns

Identify factors influencing churn

Generate actionable business insights

Key Activities

Target variable analysis (Churn vs Non-Churn)

Univariate and multivariate analysis

Visualization of trends and relationships

Feature impact exploration

Key Insights

Customer churn is imbalanced, with fewer churned customers

Certain demographics and usage behaviors strongly correlate with churn

Behavioral and service-related features are key churn drivers

# 🤖 Churn Modeling

Notebook: CHURN_MODELLING.ipynb

Objectives

Build predictive models to identify churn risk

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Compare multiple algorithms

Key Activities

Train-test split

Feature scaling and preprocessing

Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Tree-based models)

Model evaluation using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

Outcome

A validated machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn

Clear understanding of which features influence churn probability
